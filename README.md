# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project
Gain an understanding of how launch dates and funding goals affect kickstarter campaign outcomes for theater plays using data from 2009 to 2017. 

### Purpose
To describe and visualize kickstarter campaign outcomes for theater plays based on launch dates and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

## Results

-What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch date?

Based on the Figure 1. the Kickstarter theater campaigns started a successful launch in the late spring, peaking in the month of May, and remaining more favorable than any other time of year through the summer dropping below *optimal* by August.  The worst month for a successful outcome is December.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Based on Figure 2. the highest percentage of successful campaigns launched were in the less than $1000 USD range with almost 80% of those reaching their goals of funds.  The highest propensity of failure occured over $45,000 USD, and in general the trend for failure outpaced success for campaigns over $15,000 USD.

- What are some limitiations of this dataset?
- What are some other possibile tables and/or graphs that we could create?
